# <center> Atari Breakout coding diary</center>
What new knowledge you learned
* Learned about sprites and  how to add text

What old knowledge you dusted off
* Inheritance to parent and sibling classes using super()
* Chosing what classes I need along with representation choces felt like 120 

what was easiest/most fun:
The easiest part was the game screen. I think I was able to encapsulate the actual atari game screen. Al,though the most fun part was coding the colisions. They were just so much more easier than all the other colissions I have coded so far. 


where did you struggle?
* I started the game under the impression that there was no starter code as it had not been posted yet.
* I had done all the coding except a score keeping mechanism before the starter code was uploaded.
* I tried to convert my pre-existing code incorporating the starter code but I struggled with it.
* I realized that I have always had trouble with incorporating a pre-existing script into another form that I have not written from scratch. I find it much easier to justn code it from scratch.
* If I had more time, I do not think it would be tough to add sound effects to the game.


* THis game is the same as the Version 1 that I had with a considerably bigger paddle and no concept of multiple lives, much better code quality and a much better brick breaking system.
