# <center> Simple Platformer coding diary</center>
What new knowledge you learned
* More keyboard input and the interesting phenomenon of gravity
* Sprite sheets and how to use them

What old knowledge you dusted off
* tried to bring back the 10 line function rule (if a function is more than 10 lines, make a new helper function) but it was an epic fail.


what was easiest/most fun:
* Easiest was making the player move. 


where did you struggle?
* The toughest for me was to flip the player. 
* I found debugging this code a lot more pain than average. 
* It took me a while to figure out that it was bette to make another class to make and update platforms instead of putting it all in the simple_platform class
