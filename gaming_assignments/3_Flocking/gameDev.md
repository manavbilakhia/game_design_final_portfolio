What new knowledge you learned
* Mouse input and new way to think and imagine vectors in a CS manner instead of physics

What old knowledge you dusted off
* Vector math


What was easiest/most fun:
* Having multiple agents on the screen, Try it with 100 agents. makes some really cool graphics


Where did you struggle?
* The toughest part was making the separation method. 
* Another thing that I tried to do is make my arrive and seek method a bit generalized so that they can be used multiple times instead of
repeating similar code. It was somewhat a success, not a complete success.
