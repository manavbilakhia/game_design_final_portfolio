What new knowledge you learned
* the diagonal travelling. So far I have only worked with the floodfill algorithm, hence it was interestind to see a more general case of thatn algorithm

What old knowledge you dusted off
* Manhattan distance


What was easiest/most fun:
* Manhattan distance


Where did you struggle?
* The diagonal part was a bit challenging as I needed to have a much better understanding of the algorithm than I expected. 
* It did get easy after a bit.
