What new knowledge you learned
* States and Transitions

What old knowledge you dusted off
* Lambda calculus


What was easiest/most fun:
* Adding multipole characters

Where did you struggle?
* I struggled with the looping behavior. James helped me with the algorithm behind it
* I earlier thought that I understood the main mechanism of Finite staten machines which was initially flawed
* I have now understood and, I am performing all the desired behavior by actually using the FSM instead of using a workaround. 

Things to see?
* all characters that start on the green side will be orange
* all characters that go through a transition will change their color
* all characters that start on the red side have will be orange
* all characters on the green side shall wander
* all characters on the red side shall move in a corkscrew manner. 
* all characters will freeze when they are within a certain distance of the edge.
