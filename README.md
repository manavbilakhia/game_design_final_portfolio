# <center>Part 3: Grade bid</center>

* I think I should get an A- in the class as I have made revisions to all the games where required functionality was missing i.e. breakout and FSM. All other gaems always had all the required features. 
* As promised I did learn the basics of vim
* As promissed, I did not miss class
* As promissed, I did do a write up on physics in the context of games. The one thing I did want to do an extra thing here more than the contract says but could not is to add code snippets for the physics. 
* I did cover all topics on my KWL. 
* The reason I ask for an A- instead of an A is because I was still not able to figure out proper looping behavior using steering instead of hacking into the position.
